# About
Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are groups of co-located genes that work together to produce a specific biochemical compound, often with complex structures and significant bioactivities. 
These gene clusters are paramount in functional microbiome research because they can encode a vast array of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, and anticancer agents. 
Studying BGCs allows researchers to understand the roles of microbial communities in various environments, including their interactions, survival strategies, and contributions to host health. 
By identifying and characterizing BGCs within microbiomes, scientists can discover new natural products with potential therapeutic applications, thereby advancing drug discovery and biotechnology. 
Moreover, insights into BGCs can help elucidate the ecological functions of microbes, enhancing our understanding of microbial ecosystems and their impacts on broader environmental processes


The **Biosynthetic Gene Cluster Explorer** (**BGC Explorer**) is a python module written as a rotation project for the [Fischbach Group](https://www.fischbachgroup.org/). 
It uses bacterial organism, gene, and domain functional data from the JGI IMG database and predicted gene clusters (determined by [Peter Cimermancic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4123684/)) to group BGCs into families based on gene set similarity
and filtering criterion (eg. taxa and BGC product). It also provides a way of visually exploring these clusters to find patterns and similarity.
